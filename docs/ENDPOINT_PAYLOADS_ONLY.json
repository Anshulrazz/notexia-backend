              "answer": "The event loop is the heart of JavaScript's asynchronous execution model. Here's how it works:\n\n1. **Call Stack**: Synchronous code executes on the call stack, one operation at a time.\n\n2. **Web APIs**: When you encounter async operations (setTimeout, fetch, etc.), they're handed to the browser's Web APIs, which run in the background.\n\n3. **Callback Queue**: Once the Web API completes its work, the callback is placed in the callback queue.\n\n4. **Event Loop**: The event loop constantly checks if the call stack is empty. When it is, it takes the first callback from the callback queue and pushes it to the call stack.\n\nExample:\nconsole.log('Start');\nsetTimeout(() => console.log('Inside timeout'), 1000);\nconsole.log('End');\n\nOutput: Start, End, Inside timeout (after 1 second)"
